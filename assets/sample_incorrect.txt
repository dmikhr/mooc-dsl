Each new question starts after 3 equal symbols. This is the second question. It will provide multiple options for an answer.
For multiple options use brackets "[]". For this type of question number of correct answers can be 1 or more.
When choosing type of question (one answer possible or multiple), signs that identify the type of a question "o" or "[]" should be consistent among all options,
otherwise it will be considered as syntax error.

[] second option*
